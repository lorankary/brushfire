# brushfire
goal based pathfinding

example code from 2017

Allow diagonals and incorporate some logic from Sebastion Lague's A* pathfinding.
Adjacent neighbors have a distance of 10 while diagonal neighbors have a distance of 14.
A cell's distance will be reset when a shorter path is found.  
The chain of parents will always be the shortest route.

Animated version added 2/22/21 -- The brushfire loop runs in animation mode.

Use the R key to run or stop the animation.
Use the S key to step one loop in the animation.
